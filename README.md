# Context
This project illustrate how to develop a web applicaiton with Angular and this is my first high school Angular project.

# Dependency 
This project depends on the APIs provided in other project at (https://github.com/yinbri/my-rewards-api.git). The API project needs to installed and tested successfully first so that this project has the needed APIs in place.

# Install Node.js (skip if you have it installed already)

Download Node.js from: https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/, e.g. Windows Installer 64-bit, and run the installation. This will also install NPM (NodeJS Package Manager). Test NodeJS installation

```
>node --version
V18.14.2
```
# Install Angular CLI
```
    >npm install -g @angular/cli

    - Or upgrade if needed
  
    >ng update @angular/cli @angular/cor
```

# Create an Angular application
```
    >ng new my-rewards-web
```

# Test the application
```
    >cd my-rewards-web
    >ng serve --port 8081 --open
    The "--open" flag will open browser to access the application
```

# Install ag grid 
The grid can be found at https://ag-grid.com/angular-data-grid/getting-started/#grid-dependencies

```
    >press ctrl-c to stop the app if it is running
    >npm install --save ag-grid-community
    >npm install --save ag-grid-angular
```

# Install ngx-device-detector
It is used by this project to detect whether mobile browser is used. This project adjust the contents to fit into mobiel that has smaller screens.

```
    >npm install ngx-device-detector --save
```

# Add more components to create a skeleton
```
    >cd .\src\app
    >ng g class models/activity --type=model
    >ng g c components/about
    >ng g c components/activitylist
    >ng g c components/admin
    >ng g c components/leaderboard
    >ng g c components/login
    >ng g c components/logout
    >ng g c components/rewards
```

# Code documentation

### proxy.config.json
    It is a proxy that proxy all API request from Angular components to the Python API
    All requests that the "/api/" included in URL will be proxyed to the Python API

### index.html
    This is the entry point and it contains the whole Angular app using a tag of <app-root>.

### app.modules.ts
    It contains all modules created in this application.
    It also contains all imported modules including AgGridModule.

### app.component.ts
    Its uses the ngx-device-detector library to determine whether the application is processing a request from mobile devices
    It record the isMobile indicator into the commonService class as well.

### app.component.html
    It is the home page of the application that contains navigation bar.
    It hides "About" for mobile users due to limited screen size on mobile
    It only shows "Sign Out", "Activities", adn "Rewards" menu for signed in users.
    It uses the *ngIf Angular tag to hide HTML elements

### app-routing.module.ts
    It contains the Angular Routes that maps an incoming URL to an Angular component.

### about
    This component contains the static contents in the about.component.html file
    It has my school's lego, name and usage of this application

### login
    login.component.html present email and password for user to enter
        If username and password entered can't be found it will present error message
        It binds the two data fields (username, password) on HTML with the data fields in the login.component.ts
    login.component.ts processes login
        It calls the commonService to process login
        If a login is a success, it records authentication as yes in the commonService and save username into session storage
        It also navigates to the activity component so that user can see the activities after a successful log in.
        It support enrollment as well.

### activitylist
    activitylist.html use the AgGrid control to present activity list.
        The AgGrid has a tag named as <ag-grid-angular>. The list of parameters in the tag is to support adjustment of the default behaviro ofthe grid.
        Two key inputs are [columnDef] that provides a list of columns, and [rowData] that provides that actual data of the list.
    activitylist.ts contains column definitions for the grid.
        It calls the commonService to retrieve the list of activities and assign it to the [rowData]

### Refer to source codes for other components
    All code follow the same Angular component structure with each component contains ts file, html file and css file.

# start the Angular web application
```
    >cd my-rewards
    >ng serve --port 8081
```

# access the web application from browser
```
    http://localhost:8081
    or
    http://[::1]:8081
```
